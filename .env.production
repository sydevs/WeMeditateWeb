# .env.production
#
# Production environment variables embedded at build time by Vite.
# This file is committed to git (contains no secrets).
#
# These are used when Cloudflare auto-builds from git, since wrangler.toml [vars]
# are runtime-only and not available during the Vite build step.

# SahajCloud CMS URL (PayloadCMS)
# This is the same value as in wrangler.toml [vars], but needed here for Vite build-time
