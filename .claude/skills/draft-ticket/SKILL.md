# Draft Ticket

Draft a well-formed GitHub issue for the **WeMeditateWeb** repo (Vike + React + Cloudflare Workers frontend that consumes the SahajCloud PayloadCMS over REST). Matches the repo's conventional-commits + acceptance-criteria + test-plan style.

## Workflow

1. **Classify the request.** Feature / bug / refactor / enhancement / docs.
2. **Gather context.** Read related code, recent PRs (`gh pr list --limit 20`), and similar past issues (`gh issue list --search "<keyword>"`). Don't draft blindly.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** when scope is ambiguous. Better to ask than to draft the wrong ticket. Common gaps: which page / component / locale / CMS content type is affected, expected vs. actual behavior, what "done" looks like.
4. **Choose a template** from `templates/` (feature, bug, enhancement) and adapt.
5. **Write the title** using conventional commit format. See `conventions.md` for the scopes in use.
6. **Write the body.** Be specific. Use file:line refs. Avoid vague language ("improve X", "make Y better").
7. **Plan-mode approval is the sign-off.** The draft-ticket skill runs in plan mode; the user reviews the title + body in the plan file and approves it via `ExitPlanMode`. No separate "ready to create?" prompt after that — plan approval authorizes the `gh issue create` call.
8. **Create the issue.** Stage the body to a **session-unique** temp file — never a fixed path like `/tmp/gh-issue-body.md`, which collides between parallel Claude instances and has caused data loss before. Use `mktemp` or embed a random suffix:
   ```bash
   BODY_FILE=$(mktemp -t gh-issue-body.XXXXXX).md
   # write the body to "$BODY_FILE" (Write tool), then:
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file "$BODY_FILE"
   ```
   (File-based approach preserves markdown fidelity — `--body` mangles backticks and indentation.)
9. **Return the issue URL** to the user.

## Title format

Conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples from this repo's recent history:

- `fix(cms): send select + populate on all API client collection reads`
- `feat: Cloudflare Images integration with predefined variants`
- `refactor: remove redundant CMS config passing using Hono context storage`
- `chore(claude): audit and rewrite hook config`

Title ≤ 70 chars. Subject in imperative mood ("add", not "added" / "adds").

Note: many existing **issues** use an `Area: description` style (`Pages: baseline rich-text renderer`, `Meditations: music offering + related content`). Either is acceptable for issue titles; prefer conventional-commit form when the type/scope is clear, since the implementer can reuse it verbatim as the PR/commit title.

## Body structure

See `templates/<type>.md` for full templates. All issues should have:

- `## Summary` — one paragraph: what + why
- Either `## Proposed changes` (for features/refactors) or `## Observed behavior` / `## Expected behavior` (for bugs)
- `## Acceptance criteria` — markdown checklist of testable conditions
- `## Files affected` (optional) — the files you'd expect a PR to touch
- `## References` (optional) — related PRs, prior issues, external docs

## Quality bar

A good ticket can be implemented by someone who wasn't in the room when it was discussed. Bad tickets cause back-and-forth in PR review.

**Watch for:**

- "Improve X" / "make Y better" — what's the measurable end state?
- Missing acceptance criteria — how does the implementer know they're done?
- No reproduction steps (bugs) — describe the smallest path to the symptom
- Scope creep — if the body covers 3 features, draft 3 tickets
