# Reflect on Session

A meta-skill: at the end of a session, look back at what happened and propose Claude-config changes that would make future sessions smoother.

**This skill proposes changes only. It does NOT modify any files.** Read-only by design — the user reviews proposals and decides what to apply.

## Workflow

### 1. Survey what happened

Reconstruct the session from memory:

- What was the user trying to accomplish?
- What got done? What didn't?
- Where did Claude need correction or guidance?
- Where did Claude do something unexpected, slow, or risky?
- Where did permission prompts interrupt flow?
- Where did Claude have to read multiple files to figure out something that should have been documented?
- Where did the user have to repeat themselves?

Ask the user clarifying questions if specific friction points aren't clear from your own recollection.

### 2. Categorize each friction point

| Category                | Symptom                                                                               | Likely intervention                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Knowledge gap**       | Claude didn't know a project fact; user had to explain                                | Add to `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `STORYBOOK.md`, `MCP_USAGE.md`, or auto-memory |
| **Skill gap**           | A multi-step workflow was reconstructed from scratch instead of one-shot              | New `.claude/skills/*` skill                                                     |
| **Permission friction** | Same Bash/MCP tool prompted for approval repeatedly                                   | Add to `.claude/settings.json` permissions allow list                           |
| **Hook gap**            | A manual step ran after every change (e.g., regenerate types) that wasn't automated   | New `.claude/hooks/*` PostToolUse hook                                           |
| **Memory gap**          | User correction or non-obvious decision that future Claude would benefit from knowing | Save to the project memory dir (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`)                |
| **Tool gap**            | Claude lacked access to a tool that would have been useful (MCP, etc.)                | Add to `.mcp.json`                                                              |
| **Style mismatch**      | Claude's communication style didn't match the task (too verbose, too terse)           | Use or refine an output style in `.claude/output-styles/`                        |
| **Documentation drift** | Docs said one thing but reality was another                                           | Update the stale doc (CLAUDE.md / DESIGN_SYSTEM.md / STORYBOOK.md / MCP_USAGE.md) |

### 3. Propose specific changes

For each friction point, write a concrete proposal:

```markdown
### Proposal N: [short title]

- **Friction observed:** [What slowed things down or went wrong]
- **Category:** [from table above]
- **Proposed change:**
  - File: `path/to/file`
  - Change: [specific addition / removal / edit, with content sketch]
- **Why this helps:** [How future sessions benefit]
- **Effort:** [5 min / 30 min / 2 hr]
- **Risk:** [Low / Medium / High — what could go wrong]
```

Order proposals by **(impact / effort) ratio** — quick wins first.

### 4. Identify _non_-actionable observations

Some friction is normal, not config gaps:

- Claude wrote sloppy code on the first try and the user corrected it — that's how the work happens, not a config problem
- A novel one-off task — no permanent intervention warranted
- Something that's already handled but Claude forgot to use it — flag the existing tool; don't add a new one

Briefly list these so the user knows they were considered and dismissed.

### 5. Highlight what worked well

Equally important: note approaches the user _didn't_ push back on. If Claude made a non-obvious judgment call that the user accepted, that pattern is worth reinforcing — propose saving it as a `feedback` memory.

Per the auto-memory guidance: save from success as well as failure, or future Claude will drift away from validated approaches.

### 6. Present and wait

Output the full list of proposals. Then **stop and ask the user**:

- Which proposals would you like to apply now?
- Which should we defer to a separate session?
- Which are wrong / don't reflect what you observed?

Do NOT apply any changes. This skill exists to surface ideas, not to act on them.

## Output format

```markdown
## Session Reflection — <one-line task summary>

### What we worked on

[2-3 sentences]

### Proposals

1. [Proposal #1 in the format above]
2. [Proposal #2]
3. [...]

### Non-actionable observations

- [Friction that's normal / one-off / already handled]

### Worked well — worth reinforcing

- [Patterns to preserve, possibly via feedback memory]

### What I'd like clarification on (optional)

- [Friction points where I'm not sure what would help]
```

## Quality bar

A useful reflection is **specific**. Bad reflection: "Claude could have been more efficient." Good reflection: "Claude ran `pnpm test:run` 4 times when only 1 was needed because it didn't know component tests are co-located. Propose a one-line note in CLAUDE.md's Testing section pointing at the co-location convention."

If a proposed change is hand-wavy ("improve documentation"), refine it until it has a file path and a content sketch.

## When NOT to use this skill

- Mid-session — wait until the work is actually done and the session is winding down
- After a trivial task — three minor file edits don't need a reflection
- When the user explicitly says "we're done, don't suggest improvements" — respect that

## Hard rules

- **Never** modify any file from this skill. Read-only.
- **Never** propose a change without a specific file path.
- **Never** pad the proposal list to look thorough — quality over quantity.
- **Always** end with explicit "which of these would you like to apply?" — don't assume.
