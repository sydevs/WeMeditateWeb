Procedure:
- Visit the URL and examine the existing HTML and CSS. Don't use Puppeteer to take screenshots, if you need a screenshot ask me for it.
- Create appropriate components and variations while following the instructions and specifications in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Rely entirely on Tailwind tokens and avoid creating any custom CSS or tokens. If custom CSS, custom tokens or absolute values are needed, consult me first. For all sizes (widths, spacing, text size, padding, etc), use the closest Tailwind token.
- Always follow the Atomic design methodology
- Ensure that all components follow best practices for front end implementation, including ARIA tags and semantic html.
- For molecules and organisms, pay special attention to responsive design.
